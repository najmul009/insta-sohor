            <h3>Q1: How does js work?</h3>
            <p class="d-flex w-75">
                <strong class="px-2">Ans:</strong>
                <span> As we know javascript is mother of web and it's called       client site language (also it works on
                    server site).
                    Mainly javascript is a single threaded programing language. It is Interpreted and just-in-time
                    compiled language which means it can run a program line by line and execute each line of code by
                    just-in-time compilation.Also it's a synchronous language but some cases it's work like asynchronous
                    which is handel by eventloop. JS works on Execution Context which means Execution Context first read
                    the full code and divides into two parts.First part are stored variables and functions ,and second
                    part are handel funtion calling/invoking.The main part of Javascript code execution in Call Stack.
                    Call stack basicaly means last in first out ! That means it's creating a stack and listing the
                    functions and executing last to first.This is how simply JavaScript Works.

            <h3>Q2: what does js event loop do?</h3>
            <p class="d-flex w-75">
                <strong class="px-2">Ans:</strong>
                <span>As we know JavaScript is a single-threaded synchronous programming language. But some cases it's work like asynchronously programming language. The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. Event loop works on 3 steps,
                    
                    1-Call stack,                    
                    2-Heap,
                    3-Queue.
                    
                
                JavaScript creates the execution contexts, pushes, and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution phase. If a function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. For example, setTimeout/fetch. When call stack get a blocking function it pass the function onto Heap. Heap Data stored randomly and when any function/method done it pass onto Queue. The Queue are stored data sequently and waiting for clear call stack.When call stack is clear Queue send new function to the call stack and call stack execute this. This is how Event Loop works.

            <h3>Q3: Difference between local storage and session storage.</h3>
            <p class="d-flex w-75">
                <strong class="px-2">Ans:</strong>
                <span>
                    local storage and session storage are same thing. But main difference between is localStorage data doesn't expire but session storage data is cleared when the page/session close. They also have some difference like, the local storage can store 5MB/10MB on the other hand session storage can store only 5MB.Also you have to delete local storage data by javascript or manually but session storage data is stored only for the duration of a session. And when the session is closed the data are automaticaly delete from session storage .
